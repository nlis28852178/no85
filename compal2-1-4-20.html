He took us through several exercises to teach us the importance of understanding your teammates, working together for a common target, and share your rewards once the goal is accomplished.  I felt that the method used were very untraditional and making the events very interesting.  After completing these events, I had thought there should not be any more challenges going into the second day.  Oh man, was I wrong.</p></td>
